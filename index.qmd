I am an [Assistant Teaching Professor of Sociology and Demography](https://sociology.la.psu.edu/people/nxs851) at [The Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/). My research has been about interconnections between fertility and inequality, census data evaluation, mortality trends, and aging, focusing on Latin America, Brazil, and Argentina. My current work looks at the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on Latin American fertility trends.

I have an academic background in sociology, demography, and applied statistics, and professional experience consulting for the private and public sectors.I believe in the importance of communicating scientific-driven insights to all audiences. I have grown a particular interest in census data evaluation, the [Latin American Observatory of Population Censuses](https://observatoriocensal.org/).
